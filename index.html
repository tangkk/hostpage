<h3><strong>About</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
	<li>I am Junqi Deng.</li>
	<li>I got my <a href="https://github.com/tangkk/phd-thesis-junqi-deng/blob/master/junqi-thesis-hku.pdf">PhD</a> degree in computer engineering at The University of Hong Kong.</li>
	<li>I am deeply involved in the <a href="https://www.ismir.net/">Music Information Retrieval</a> community.
	<li>I design computer systems for music applications.</li>
	<li>Here is my <a href="https://tangkk.github.io/CV/CV.pdf">CV</a> and its <a href="https://tangkk.github.io/CV/CV-cn.pdf">Chinese version</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Work</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Alibaba Music, Senior Algorithm Engineer (2017.12 - Now).<br/>
	I design and implement Xiami's audio fingerprinting system.<br/>
	I also design and implement several auto-accompaniment systems for the "music exploration lab", which is a submodule in Xiami App.</li>

	<li>Kugou Music, Senior Algorithm Engineer (2016.10 - 2017.12).<br/>
	I designed and implemented an auto-accompaniment system,<br/>
	a music genre classification system for both Chinese and non-Chinese music,<br/>
	and a word2vec based music recommendation scheme.<br/>
	All of these had been put into real production.</li>
</ul>
