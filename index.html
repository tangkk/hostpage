I dislike, and sometimes look down upon, those full of (random) ideas, but fail to appreciate the difficulties behind real implementations.</br>
我不喜欢，有时甚至是瞧不起，那些总是有很多想法，但却不懂得欣赏工程实现背后的复杂性的人。

<h3><strong>About</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
	<li>I am Junqi Deng. I am a researcher, a programmer, and a musician.</li>
	<li>I got my <a href="https://github.com/tangkk/phd-thesis-junqi-deng/blob/master/junqi-thesis-hku.pdf">PhD</a> degree in computer engineering at The University of Hong Kong.</li>
	<li>I am deeply involved in the <a href="https://www.ismir.net/">Music Information Retrieval</a> community.
	<li>I design computer systems for music applications.</li>
	<li>Here is my <a href="https://tangkk.github.io/CV/CV.pdf">CV</a> and its <a href="https://tangkk.github.io/CV/CV-cn.pdf">Chinese version</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Work</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Alibaba XLab, Senior Algorithm Engineer (2019.7 - Now).<br/>
	I lead the design and implementation of HeyHo Autorap（嘿猴说唱） in the HeyHo App （嘿猴短视频）.
	I am also the main contributor of its code.
	(the project officially started at around 2018.10 when I was still with Alibaba Music)
	</li>
	
	<li>Alibaba Music, Senior Algorithm Engineer (2017.12 - 2019.7).<br/>
	I design and implement Xiami's audio fingerprinting system.（虾米音频指纹系统）<br/>
	I design and implement several auto-accompaniment systems（自动伴奏系统） for the Music Exploration Lab（探乐实验室） in Xiami App.<br/>
	</li>

	<li>Tencent Music Entertainment Group (at Kugou Music), Senior Algorithm Engineer (2016.10 - 2017.12).<br/>
	I designed and implemented an auto-accompaniment system,<br/>
	a music genre classification system for both Chinese and non-Chinese music,<br/>
	and a word2vec based music recommendation scheme.<br/>
	All of these had been put into real production.
